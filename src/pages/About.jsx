            <span className="drop">B</span>ennett and Mary Fultz's house, presently the site of the
            Fultz House Museum, remained in the family until the death of daughter Jane Emily Fultz
            in the 1940s. New tenants made several renovations to the building, adding a bay window,
            arched doorway, and enlarging the living room. By 1979, the house was in the hands of
            the provincial government and faced a demolition order to make room for an extended
            highway. Several concerned individuals and community organizations came together to
            establish the Fultz Corner Restoration Society in an attempt to save the historic house.
            The Society successfully leased the property from the provincial government, and was
            able to open the new Fultz House Museum on July 1, 1982. Today, the non-profit Fultz
            House Museum stands as a testament to the dedication of Sackville's committed
            volunteers, providing visitors with the chance to experience over 200 years of community
            history. Beyond the house itself, the Museum's collections have expanded to include an
            original cooperage (removed board-by-board from the Grace property in Middle Sackville)
            and a working replica of A.J. Smeltzer's Lower Sackville blacksmith shop. Now owned by
            the Fultz Corner Restoration Society, Fultz House has also been designated as a Halifax
            County heritage property.

          <h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of the Fultz Corner Restoration Society is to maintain the buildings and
            grounds as a community museum, and to collect, study and preserve those objects and
            artifacts that best illustrate the founding, settlement and development of the Sackville,
            Beaver Bank, and Lucasville areas from the time of earliest settlement to the present.
          </p>

          <p>The objectives of the society and museum include:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The collection and preservation of artifacts, photographs and records of historical
              significance relative to the social and economic development of the Sackville, Beaver
              Bank and Lucasville areas.
            </li>
            <li>
              Educating the public of the history of the Sackville, Beaver Bank and Lucasville areas
              by providing interaction between the Museum and the community and schools through
              exhibits, tours, programs, teas and special events.
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintaining a pleasing aesthetic environment evoking the history of Sackville and areas
              through the various buildings and gardens on the property.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since the museum services a large community then the focus of the museum should not be
              limited to only one facet of its history.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adhering to the guidelines of the Collections Policy by the periodical review of
              artifacts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Separate committees will be organized, as required, to further various aspects of the
              operation of the museum and to better utilize the expertise of its members and
              volunteers.
            </li>
            <li>
              The remaining natural woodlands on the property shall be maintained and preserved as a
              site for the study and appreciation of examples of the natural history of the area, and
              that this site be made accessible through paths and the appropriate signage.
